## Ld Explorer  

This is the new and improved version of the LDCalculator. It will provide all of the same
functionality, but will do so in a simplified and intercative application.

### Key Objectives:  

Using a pairwise distance matrix, based on the LD (R^2) values between SNPs, we aim to:

  1. produce output files suitable for Haploview  
  2. be able to view regions of LD interactively  
         - visualisations of heirarchical clustering and heatmaps  
  3. be able to 'zoom-in' on regions of high LD / high interest  
  4. be able to identify "proxy SNPs"  
  5. output pairwise-LD values in a suitable format.  

Initially, this will be implemented using 1000 Genomes data. However, this will be
designed from the outset to extend to user-specified data.
